While planning my conference sessions for .conf2015 I decided it would be fun and easier to do this in Splunk.  
The app allows you to view and filter the entire agenda on a Gantt chart.  


I got the dataset using a combination of https://conf.splunk.com/speakers.html and the Agenda planner.  The raw data was then passed into splunk  can correlated to build the csv file found in the lookups directory.
