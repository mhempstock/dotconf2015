143,16,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) uses Selenium synthetic transaction tests built in Python to monitor hosted websites. These act as a user running a real browser to visit sites and perform a set of steps. Tests are run and captured using the Universal Forwarder to gather critical data.

While these tests have been extremely valuable, manually creating tests for over 200 websites was very time consuming and difficult to maintain. Splunk to the rescue! We created a report using web logs of all the websites hosted by PNNL, grouped by server and sorted by highest traffic. Using the Splunk SDK for Python, we pulled this report and dynamically created Selenium tests that run every five minutes and test each site on the list.

Using Splunk gave us the opportunity to create a custom app that combines these synthetic transactions with our existing web logs. Now we can spot error trends and availability issues many times before our customers are even affected.","2015-09-24  12:00","Public Sector;;","113 (Level 1) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Developer;;

148,16,"Proper use of Threat Intelligence, in many cases, has a direct correlation with the amount of time it takes for your team to detect, respond to, and remediate a threat. In addition, threat intelligence providers often deliver very little, if any, context or attribution around their Intel. This makes it difficult for an analyst to determine if a match against a given feed is associated with a commodity or APT-based threat. The inability to make this distinction alone can have serious implications to a company. This discussion will focus on the role Threat Intelligence plays in an active breach investigation and how the new Threat Intelligence Framework in Splunk App for Enterprise Security can be used to fulfill this role. The audience will be walked through a simulated breach and shown how intel gleaned from compromised systems is used to assist in investigations.

Are you maintaining a large set of systems sending heterogeneous data into Splunk with a CIM-style layer on top to normalize accessing that data? Have you noticed a creeping slowdown of your search startup, or at least felt as if things sometimes didn't move along as fast as you'd like them to? 
In this session, we will explore common offenders, and what can trigger an explosion of complexity for Splunk to deal with (or not). Using examples derived from real-world experience, you will learn how small changes made at one end of your search-time configuration can have great impacts on the other. To accomplish this, we will peek under the hood of how Splunk translates higher-level search constructs into normalized searches, and how you can use this knowledge to your advantage.","2015-09-24  10:45","Technology;;","111-112 (Level 1) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Architect;;

Not so long ago, we struggled to obtain a thorough vision and a firm grasp over our IT infrastructure and applications while trying to avoid implementing several different tools. When Splunk broke in, initially for troubleshooting purposes, we embraced its vision and grew fond of its features. Now it is the key product for many different use cases, ranging from audit, compliance and security to business analytics, application management, Operational Intelligence and advanced monitoring fields.

How did the solutions get us there? Did the magic DevOps elves visit during the night? Was it Joe from Accounting? What if we could understand not only the health and status of applications, but also how they were deployed, by whom and when?
In this session, we will discover how Splunk software can provide that insight by tapping into the extensive data that drives pipelines and deployments. Also, we will investigate what problems these datasets help to solve and how you can leverage existing solutions such as Chef and Octopus Deploy.

91,11,"The KONCAR Group is an electrical, transport and energy company based in Zagreb, Croatia. Among the many companies in the group, KONCAR electrical industry builds and deploys wind turbines.
Wind turbines generate a huge amount of data about their availability, production of energy and energy losses. KONCAR previously stored this data in a SQL database and used external applications to produce various reports as well as to proactively alert when a particular wind turbine is having issues. This became extremely cumbersome as the amount of historical data kept growing.
In a successful project, INFIGO implemented Splunk as the tool for analysis and visualization of data generated by wind turbines. All complex calculations that were done before by external applications have been fully implemented in Splunk. Finally, a custom external .NET application has been developed that relies on Splunk's SDK API to produce specific PDF and Excel reports in formats requested by the customer.","2015-09-23  14:45","Energy and Utilities;;

96,11,"Security professionals and systems administrators face the difficult challenge of protecting their networks with limited resources. This challenge is compounded by the increased use of zero-day exploits, determined adversaries and small windows between when a vulnerability is announced and exploit code is available. Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and AppLocker for application whitelisting are tools which can provide valuable protection without additional software expenditures. But there's a catch: there's no console for alerting and reporting what's happening with those tools on your network.
In this discussion, we will demonstrate how you can leverage your existing investment, getting value from free tools like EMET and AppLocker by building enterprise-worthy alerting and analysis capabilities yourself. You will learn how to adapt this strategy to the unique needs of your organization. Build a console customized to show what you need to know.","2015-09-23  14:45","Higher Education;;

The aim is to build a true ecosystem, which allows all security solution providers to participate by expanding the framework with their own application. The framework establishes a standardized two-way communication channel, that enables security components to be managed centrally. Another advantage is the abstraction layer. This ensures security providers can easily be replaced at any time with a new, more suitable product.

In our joint efforts for phase 1, we brought a number of providers onboard, such as Intel, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks and EMC.

58,7,"Today, cheap commodity servers contain lots of cores. At customer sites, we often see more than 24 cores on indexer machines.
Each Splunkd instance contains a series of pipelines (Pipelineset) starting from input pipelines that feed data to Splunk, parse data and finally, index or forward data. Traditionally, this series of pipelines used to limit the number of cores splunkd could use on a machine. And our suggestions so far have been to install additional Splunk instances to increase resource utilization. However, this approach is deficient in many ways.
In this presentation, we'll talk about the multiple PipelineSet features of splunkd and how they address the above constraint.
The basic goal of this subject is to have parallel independent instances of Pipelinesets. The number of these parallel PipelineSets can be configured based on customer environments, depending on the number of cores available and other applications running on the machine.","2015-09-23  10:45",,"120 (Level 1) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Administrator;;

These events, however inevitable they may be, send chills down your spine and put you directly into disaster recovery mode. The reaction is often multiplied by the sheer scope of the compromise once you realize that the breach encompasses a multitude of systems, and not just the one or two you were initially alerted to. Thousands of endpoints and it's now your job to develop an effective remediation strategy that not only removes the current threat from the environment but also reduces the chances of the attacker re-compromising the environment post remediation.

What if your sophisticated adversary had a single pane of glass for exploitation, monitoring, command and control, billing, and Operational Intelligence? How would you compete with an already advanced adversary who is now using Splunk for Operational Intelligence? Leave your SIEM at home, this is going to hurt! 
This is an offensive talk. We will demonstrate the Crimeware Operation App for Splunk. To date, Splunk is thought of as a defensive tool. In this talk, we will demonstrate how our app is used for exploiting, managing and monetizing compromised business targets. We will show how a sophisticated attacker organization runs their business with Splunk at the center of their operations: keeping track of compromised systems, identifying new targets, discerning which targets are most lucrative and analytics for their customers?all with one motive: keeping control of your assets while making money! 
Attendee takeaway: This talk will highlight how Splunk software can be used by a malicious organization as a single pane of glass for configuration management, IT operations and business analytics.

Search Head Clustering solves this by providing highly available search heads. Administrators can group a set of machines into search head clusters and add and remove nodes dynamically as and when their requirements change.
The search heads are behind sticky load balancers which distribute the user sessions across the search head cluster members. The scheduled searches and alerts are automatically load balanced across the cluster. Configuration changes done on one search head are replicated across the members, giving an identical look and feel.
Searches are universally available throughout the cluster which gives a uniform view across the cluster. These topics and more will be covered in this session.","2015-09-22  17:00",,"111-112 (Level 1) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Architect;;

129,4,"Detecting fraud in government can be overwhelming due to the amount of data that needs to be managed. Most agencies have limited quality audit/control resources, making it difficult to gather transactional system data into a manageable subset to oversee program integrity.  But Splunk helped make the difference for the agency profiled in this session. Splunk is so flexible, they had the ability to integrate data sources without help of an application development team, and achieved cost savings because Splunk served as the one solution for security investigation, compliance reporting and program integrity issue detection. 
This session will show examples of internal threats where workers are overriding the system, as well as how to detect members of the same household receiving the same benefit. Join us to see how early detection can prevent fraud from happening and identify insider threats.

11,3,"It's important to get data into Splunk right the first time. This session will show you how to get the 'important' things right, the first time, sometimes using .conf files. Some of those important things to get right include timestamp and timezone, host extractions (which hosts to extract), sourcetype, line-breaking and index. Splunk's ""schema-on-the-fly"" allows flexibility in field extractions, but we need to index things properly to find the data. This presentation will walk customers through getting different data sources, e.g., logs, database, API calls (JIRA, SFDC), FIX data into Splunk with the correct parsing rules.","2015-09-22  13:45",,"111-112 (Level 1) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Architect;;

12,3,"Traditionally, Splunk software has been used to ingest and analyze machine-generated data. We, at the Northern Trust Bank, have extended this to ingest and analyze business transactions like cash movements in banking. This has provided us with powerful business capabilities like tracking transactions across multiple systems, calculating cash movement amounts, etc. It has also allowed us to predict business impact of certain unusual events, which has been very challenging in the past.
We have also been able to leverage the Splunk API calls to create a business-targeted application with a customized GUI interface.","2015-09-22  13:45","Financial Services;;","113 (Level 1) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Developer;;

In this discussion, we will explore real world use cases and explain how they were solved with common sense queries or perhaps some SPL trickery. Ever wondered how to format a number into dollars without losing your ability to sort or subtract with it later? What about plotting attacks on a map and coloring them according to severity? How about trying to find matches using data enrichments tools when the data doesn't completely match? You will leave this session with a set of tools for solving these examples and more.
You've been building queries, dashboards, and reports that have been blowing minds all over your company. Join us and we'll take your Splunk-titude to the next level.","2015-09-22  12:45",,"320 (Level 3) ","Splunk Enterprise;;","Operations Manager;;

7,2,"Looking to archive data from Splunk?
Hunk 6.2.1 ships with a brand new archiver feature which lets you copy your Splunk data to cheaper storage, such as HDFS or S3, while keeping it searchable in-place. All configuration is done on the Search Head and works it with your existing Splunk indexers.
The new Bucket Reader allows any Hadoop-based application to read Splunk data buckets in their native format. Combined with  Hunk archiving functionality, this allows data added to Splunk indexes to continuously be made visible to 3rd-party tools such as Hive and Pig without the need for an export process. 
In this session, you will learn what Bucket Reader can and cannot do, and how to configure and use it. We will also show examples of how to write your own applications that read Hunk data. Finally, we will discuss how this lends flexibility to data workflows. 
Join this session to see the Splunk archiver in action, learn about how it works and how it differs from existing archiving techniques.","2015-09-22  12:45",,"304-305 (Level 3) ","Splunk Enterprise;;Hunk;;","Administrator;;
