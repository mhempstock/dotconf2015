148,16,Managed Threat Intelligence in the Splunk App for Enterprise Security,"Proper use of Threat Intelligence, in many cases, has a direct correlation with the amount of time it takes for your team to detect, respond to, and remediate a threat. In addition, threat intelligence providers often deliver very little, if any, context or attribution around their Intel. This makes it difficult for an analyst to determine if a match against a given feed is associated with a commodity or APT-based threat. The inability to make this distinction alone can have serious implications to a company. This discussion will focus on the role Threat Intelligence plays in an active breach investigation and how the new Threat Intelligence Framework in Splunk App for Enterprise Security can be used to fulfill this role. The audience will be walked through a simulated breach and shown how intel gleaned from compromised systems is used to assist in investigations.

183,16,Continuous Advanced Threat Monitoring and Mitigation ? From the Edge to the Network,"Threat research from Verizon?s Data Breach Investigation Report, the industry?s most comprehensive report in the past decade, suggests that 75%+ of all attacks could be mitigated through simple to intermediate controls, with many advanced attacks detectable by looking for behavioral changes. But attacks cannot be mitigated by simply deploying smart security devices, relying upon a few sources of threat intelligence or traditional SIEM tools alone. What?s needed is a combination of real time anomaly-based detection and analytics along with globally orchestrated mitigation, and incident response, powered by the best possible threat intelligence.       
This joint presentation and demo highlights how Verizon leverages Fortinet and Splunk for a breakthrough in the way security is envisioned and delivered: Verizon?s global backbone, MSS practice and investigation team provides unique access and insight into the cyberscape.  Fortinet?s best-in-class security technology provides the instrumentation and threat intelligence for advanced gateway solutions from the customer edge to the core of Verizon?s global backbone. Splunk?s best-in-class analytics rapidly correlates vast amounts of data into meaningful alerts.  These three key elements come together as an unparalleled continuous monitoring and advanced threat mitigation system.

45B,7,Breach Management in Splunk App for Enterprise Security,"Whether it's through your internal security team or via a letter from the FBI, being notified that your company has been compromised is in no way a good thing. These events, however inevitable they may be, send chills down your spine and put you directly into disaster recovery mode. The reaction is often multiplied by the sheer scope of the compromise once you realize that the breach encompasses a multitude of systems, and not just the one or two you were initially alerted to. Thousands of endpoints and it's now your job to develop an effective remediation strategy that not only removes the current threat from the environment but also reduces the chances of the attacker re-compromising the environment post remediation. This discussion will show how Splunk App for Enterprise Security can be used to scope and manage a breach in a structured and organized manner. Making an already stressful situation feel a little less daunting. This session repeats in breakout 6.

96,11,Create a Console for Security Apps That Don't Have One,"Security professionals and systems administrators face the difficult challenge of protecting their networks with limited resources. This challenge is compounded by the increased use of zero-day exploits, determined adversaries and small windows between when a vulnerability is announced and exploit code is available. Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and AppLocker for application whitelisting are tools which can provide valuable protection without additional software expenditures. But there's a catch: there's no console for alerting and reporting what's happening with those tools on your network.
In this discussion, we will demonstrate how you can leverage your existing investment, getting value from free tools like EMET and AppLocker by building enterprise-worthy alerting and analysis capabilities yourself. You will learn how to adapt this strategy to the unique needs of your organization.

32B,8,Using Splunk for Cyber Crime: How Would You Compete When Your Sophisticated Adversary Levels Up to World-Class Operational Intelligence? ,"This talk is a must for C-level audiences and security practitioners alike. What if a well-resourced, advanced and malicious organization chose to use Splunk? What if your sophisticated adversary had a single pane of glass for exploitation, monitoring, command and control, billing, and Operational Intelligence? How would you compete with an already advanced adversary who is now using Splunk for Operational Intelligence? Leave your SIEM at home, this is going to hurt! 
This is an offensive talk. We will demonstrate the Crimeware Operation App for Splunk. To date, Splunk is thought of as a defensive tool. In this talk, we will demonstrate how our app is used for exploiting, managing and monetizing compromised business targets. We will show how a sophisticated attacker organization runs their business with Splunk at the center of their operations: keeping track of compromised systems, identifying new targets, discerning which targets are most lucrative and analytics for their customers?all with one motive: keeping control of your assets while making money! 
Attendee takeaway: This talk will highlight how Splunk software can be used by a malicious organization as a single pane of glass for configuration management, IT operations and business analytics.

58,7,Splunkd with Multiple Pipelinesets,"Today, cheap commodity servers contain lots of cores. At customer sites, we often see more than 24 cores on indexer machines.
Each Splunkd instance contains a series of pipelines (Pipelineset) starting from input pipelines that feed data to Splunk, parse data and finally, index or forward data. Traditionally, this series of pipelines used to limit the number of cores splunkd could use on a machine. And our suggestions so far have been to install additional Splunk instances to increase resource utilization. However, this approach is deficient in many ways.
In this presentation, we'll talk about the multiple PipelineSet features of splunkd and how they address the above constraint.
The basic goal of this subject is to have parallel independent instances of Pipelinesets. The number of these parallel PipelineSets can be configured based on customer environments, depending on the number of cores available and other applications running on the machine.",2015-09-23,2015-09-23 10:00,2015-09-23 10:45,Unknown,120 (Level 1) ,Splunk Enterprise,Administrator;;Architect;;Developer;;Operations Manager;;Security Analyst,Advanced,Unknown,"Jag Kerai - Director of Engineering, Splunk;;Abhinav Nekkanti - Software Engineer, Splunk",Splunk Classics,Breakout Sessions

28,5,Search Head Clustering,"Search Head Clustering is Splunk's horizontal scaling solution for searches. As enterprises onboard more users onto Splunk deployments and the need for dashboards and alerts goes up, and search heads need to be scaled out horizontally to manage the search load.
Search Head Clustering solves this by providing highly available search heads. Administrators can group a set of machines into search head clusters and add and remove nodes dynamically as and when their requirements change.
The search heads are behind sticky load balancers which distribute the user sessions across the search head cluster members. The scheduled searches and alerts are automatically load balanced across the cluster. Configuration changes done on one search head are replicated across the members, giving an identical look and feel.
Searches are universally available throughout the cluster which gives a uniform view across the cluster. These topics and more will be covered in this session.",2015-09-22,2015-09-22 16:15,2015-09-22 17:00,Unknown,111-112 (Level 1) ,Splunk Enterprise,Architect;;Administrator,Advanced,Unknown,"Manu Jose - Senior Engineer, Splunk;;Eric Woo - Senior Engineer, Splunk",Deploying,Breakout Sessions
43,6,Deeper Insights into Water Treatment Through Splunk,"Denver Water is located in one of the healthiest states in the U.S. Being healthy means different things for different people. If you have the time, you can read food labels to see what?s in your food, but what about when you turn on the tap? Our mission is to make sure customers receive clean, safe, great-tasting water every day.
Our drinking water is 100 percent surface water that comes from rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs and springs fed by high-quality mountain snow runoff. We vigilantly safeguard our mountain water supplies, and we carefully treat the water before it reaches our customer's tap.
Part of ensuring water quality is making sure we have adequate monitoring of our water quality from our supplies through our treatment. To do this, we need analytics that leverage our existing SCADA/ICS system and our reservoir monitoring. In this presentation, we?ll show you how we made disparate sources available to different departments within Denver Water.

Manual installation can be time consuming, and error prone if there is not some structure around the installation. Typos can render an installation of the Splunk UF useless, even detrimental to your environment.
In this session, we'll share best practices from our Splunk instance. We use a set of scripts to enable the installation of the UF on Linux, AIX and Windows to be able to be done by non-Splunk-savvy administrators so that there are no mistakes or errors in the install or configuration. This also requires effective use of the Deployment Server. In this manner the UF can be selectively installed as needed by the owners of the host services.
As a result of the scripted installation, errors in the installation are eliminated and only minimal work needs to be done by a Splunk administrator, making better use of the administrator's time and talents.",2015-09-22,2015-09-22 17:15,2015-09-22 18:00,Nonprofit,115-116 (Level 1) ,Splunk Enterprise,Architect;;Administrator,Good for All Skill Levels,Customer Success Story,"Cary Petterborg - Senior Monitoring Engineer, LDS Church",Deploying,Breakout Sessions

32,3,Using Splunk for Cyber Crime: How Would You Compete When Your Sophisticated Adversary Levels Up to World-Class Operational Intelligence? ,"This talk is a must for C-level audiences and security practitioners alike. What if a well-resourced, advanced and malicious organization chose to use Splunk? What if your sophisticated adversary had a single pane of glass for exploitation, monitoring, command and control, billing, and Operational Intelligence? How would you compete with an already advanced adversary who is now using Splunk for Operational Intelligence? Leave your SIEM at home, this is going to hurt! 
This is an offensive talk. We will demonstrate the Crimeware Operation App for Splunk. To date, Splunk is thought of as a defensive tool. In this talk, we will demonstrate how our app is used for exploiting, managing and monetizing compromised business targets. We will show how a sophisticated attacker organization runs their business with Splunk at the center of their operations: keeping track of compromised systems, identifying new targets, discerning which targets are most lucrative and analytics for their customers?all with one motive: keeping control of your assets while making money! 
Attendee takeaway: This talk will highlight how Splunk software can be used by a malicious organization as a single pane of glass for configuration management, IT operations and business analytics. And if attendees are not using Splunk, attendees will learn that they don?t stand a chance of competing with a well-resourced adversary who is now using Splunk! This session repeats in breakout 8.

148B,2,Managed Threat Intelligence in the Splunk App for Enterprise Security,"Proper use of Threat Intelligence, in many cases, has a direct correlation with the amount of time it takes for your team to detect, respond to, and remediate a threat. In addition, threat intelligence providers often deliver very little, if any, context or attribution around their Intel. This makes it difficult for an analyst to determine if a match against a given feed is associated with a commodity or APT-based threat. The inability to make this distinction alone can have serious implications to a company. This discussion will focus on the role Threat Intelligence plays in an active breach investigation and how the new Threat Intelligence Framework in Splunk App for Enterprise Security can be used to fulfill this role. The audience will be walked through a simulated breach and shown how intel gleaned from compromised systems is used to assist in investigations. Attendees can expect to gain a rudimentary understanding of how they can begin managing their own threat intel for use in active or future investigations.
